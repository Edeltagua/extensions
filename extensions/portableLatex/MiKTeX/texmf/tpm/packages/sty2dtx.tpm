The macro name is automatically inserted as an argument to the macro environemnt. Code lines outside macro definitions are wrapped only in macrocode environments. Empty lines are removed. The script should not be thought to be fool proof and 100% accurate but rather as a good start to the business of making a .dtx file from an undocumented style file. Full .dtx files are generated. A template based on the skeleton file from 'dtxtut' is used. User level macros are added automatically to the 'Usage' section of the .dtx file. A corresponding .ins file can be generated as well.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="26130">texmf\scripts\sty2dtx\perl\sty2dtx.pl texmf\tpm\packages\sty2dtx.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="4794">texmf\doc\support\sty2dtx\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1296727096</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>4a48fd624351e528c0103342f75cd704</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
